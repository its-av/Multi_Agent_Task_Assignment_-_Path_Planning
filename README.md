# Multi_Agent_Task_Assignment_&_Path_Planning
 
 The Multi-agent Task Assignment and Path Plan- ning problem is a well-known warehouse problem in which a collection of robots is tasked with carrying products from one area to another. It appears in the context of automated warehouse logistics and automated mail sortation, and it necessitates first
  determining which robot is assigned to which task 
  (i.e., Task Assignment or TA), then a subsequent
   coordination problem in which each robot must be 
   assigned collision-free paths in order to 
   successfully complete its assignment (i.e., Multi-Agent Path Finding or MAPF). 
   Paths should be found for numerous agents, each with a different start and target point, 
   so that agents do not collide in the multi agent path finding problem (MAPF).
